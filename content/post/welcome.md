### Welcome on my dev blog friends :)

Nice to have you on this site!

I plan to write here some hopefully interesting things from time to time, mostly about programming.

Some words about me:

I'm Damian, ~24 years old and I'm from Poland.
I like to code, travel and play computer games.

I work as web developer using mostly Javascript and Ruby and learning Elixir in my spare time.

I'm interested in software engineering, algorithms and AI.
